- **Parallel(resistors: list)**: This is used to calculate the total resistance of various resistors in parallel.

- **Potential_divider(voltage: float,resistors: list)**: This function is sued to calculate the voltage drops in a series circuit.

- **temperature_check(temp: float, unit: str)**: Determines if a patient's temperature is normal, hypothermic, or hyperthermic.


# ECSE3038 Lab 1 - Why this code exists
This code exists due to an assignment provided by my lecturer as part of the University of the West Indies


# ECSE3038 Lab 1- A short joke 
A little girl goes into a pet show and asks for a wabbit. The shop keeper looks down at her, smiles and says:

"Would you like a lovely fluffy little white rabbit, or a cutesy wootesly little brown rabbit?"

"Actually", says the little girl, "I don't think my python would notice."
